Requirement is that, create a trigger which will auto insert the value in 3 columns of a table in MY-SQL enviornment:
Complete requirement:
There is a table 'sample_invoice' having below columns in it:

1.InvoiceNumber --> Normal insertion (via insert into)
2.Carrier_id    --> Normal insertion (via insert into)
3.Account_no    --> Normal insertion (via insert into)
4.Amount        --> Normal insertion (via insert into)  
5.Invoice_date  --> Normal insertion (via insert into)  
6.Customername  --> Normal insertion (via insert into)  
7.No_of_pallets --> Normal insertion (via insert into)  
8.Stocktype     --> Normal insertion (via insert into)  
9.Connote       --> insert data via trigger (NEW.<>)
10.AltConnote   --> insert data via trigger (NEW.<>)
11.Barcodes     --> insert data via trigger (NEW.<>)
------------------------------------------------------------
We will only insert values for the first 7 columns that is InvoiceNumber,Carrier_id,Account_no,Amount,Invoice_date,Customername,No_of_pallets,Stocktype, 
the insertion of connote, altconnote and barcode will happen via trigger.

Logic of producing the data for the columns connote, altconnote and barcode:
 
 Connote:   This has to be populated for each new line using a sequence restarting at the begining of the year : YYNNNNN, here YY- year e.g. 24, NNNNN - sequence number e.g. 0001 so Connote will be 240001. 
            Year will come from the column Invoice_date.

 AltConnote:  This has to be populated for each new line using a sequence restarting at the begining of the year : AAAANNNNN , here AAAA- account number e.g. 123444, NNNNN - sequence number e.g. 00001 so Connote will be 12344400001.
              Account number will come from the coulmn Account_no.
			  
 Barcodes : The format will be CONNOTEX-NNN, Here
            CONNOTE- is a First connote if Altconnote is blank. Otherwise, Altconnote to be used.(CONNOTE and ALTCONNOTE is comming from above explained columns.)
            X- is the Stocktype, its either H-Hanger or S-STocktype, 
			NNN- is the sequence number 
 So if we have three pallets of stocktype i.e. 'S' where Connote is T2401523 then below barcodes will be generated and assigned in a column Barcodes as comma sepearted check below sample value:  
 Column value(BARCODE): T2401523S-001,T2401523S-002,T2401523S-003 
--------------------------------------------------------------

Create a BEFORE TRIGGER, which will automatically produce the data for last 3 columns(connote, altconnote,barcodes) based on the values of first 7 columns(InvoiceNumber,Carrier_id,Account_no,Amount,Invoice_date,Customername,No_of_pallets,Stocktype)
and insert the data for last 3 columns(connote, altconnote,barcodes).

Hint, as we are using sequence restart concept, so you can use autoincrement concept or create the logic inside the trigger it-self for this.
---------------------------------------------------------------
You can refer to step_2 txt file for inserting sample data for the tables, or you can try it by your-self also.
