#Now, validate your data with the provided data, specially for the last 3 columns(Connote,AltConnote,Barcodes) which is getting generated from the TRIGGER.
/*
 For generting the sequence number for all carrier id's (jat,aussiefast,bass) along with seperate increment of the sequence with respect to their YEAR OF INVOICE DATE (Invoice_Date),
 We are using the table 'Connote_Seq' which is helping us to achive this by the help of TRIGGER logic of updation of the column seq_value.
*/

#Now, As per logic derived in the trigger, the value in column seq_value will be incremented by 1 for every insertion of the NEW.Carrier_id as well as the seq_year coming from the last 2 digit of the NEW.Invoice_Date.
#So the table 'connote_seq' will be having the data as below:

select * from Connote_Seq;

#OUTPUT:

carrierid	  seq_value	seq_year
jat	        903	      22
aussiefast	 15036	    22
bass	       4513	     22

aussiefast	 2	        23
bass	       2	        23
jat	        2	        24
aussiefast	 2	        24
bass	       2	        24

/*
 You can see the difference in the column seq_value, all the values are increased by 1, hence logic is working fine,if carrier_id is present in the table Connote_Seq,
 then for every new year, a unique sequence value will be generated by the trigger logic and will be updated in the table Connote_Seq, 
 if, values are inserted into the table sample_invoice, then same process will happen and seq_value will be increased by one for every insertion of the carrierid inserted into the table sample_invoice.

#MATCH YOUR DATA FOR EVERY STEPS AND VALIDATE THAT TRIGGER IS PERFORMING FINE OR NOT..Thank me later :)
